This repository contains impelementations of DNBGDA l[1].

To run the code, you need to prepare two R objects X, and m_len. X is the list of term-document matrix (tm package) and m_len denoces number of documents from each source at eatch time stamp. Note that all the matrices in X should be sharing the same vocabularies, therefore, they should of the same number of rows. You can load the example dataset in R to get familiar with the required format:

```
load("example_data.RData")
str(X)
str(m_len)
```

After preparing the objects, you can load the required functions by

```
source("DNBGFA_var_functions.R")
```

and then

```
model<- model_setup(X, m_len, 20)
update_model(model, iter = 1000, mc.cores = 10, print_topics = T)
```

or do

```
model<- model_setup(X, m_len, 20)
model<- update_model_interp(model, iter = 1000, inter_t = 2, mc.cores = 10)
```

for interpolation task (the second time stamp).

You can also check the file example_run.R to get familiar with the process.
